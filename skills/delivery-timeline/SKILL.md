# Delivery Timeline

Generates a delivery timeline from a completed `milestones.yaml`. Asks for delivery parameters (production deploy date, QA rounds, days per QA session), updates milestones with day estimates, and produces `timeline.yaml` with two sections: a relative-day `timeline` and a real-date `workback` schedule anchored to the production deploy date.

## Prerequisites

- Completed `milestones.yaml` (output from `/implementation-planner`)

## Usage

```
/delivery-timeline path/to/milestones.yaml
```

## Process

### Step 1: Load & Parse Milestones

Read `milestones.yaml` and extract each milestone's `id`, `name`, `dependencies`, and `estimated_duration`.

### Step 2: Gather Delivery Parameters

Ask the user the following three questions. You may present them together in a single message:

1. **Production deploy date** — "What is your desired production deploy date? (YYYY-MM-DD)"
2. **QA rounds** — "How many rounds of QA are required?"
3. **QA days per round** — "How many days should be allotted for each QA session?"

If the provided production deploy date falls on a Saturday or Sunday, warn the user:

> "Note: [date] falls on a weekend. Would you like to use [previous Friday] or [next Monday] instead?"

Wait for the user to confirm or correct before proceeding. Store the confirmed values as:
- `production_deploy_date` (ISO 8601 date string)
- `qa_rounds` (integer ≥ 1)
- `qa_days_per_round` (integer ≥ 1)

### Step 3: Convert Durations to Days

Convert each milestone's `estimated_duration` string to a whole number of business days using this table:

| estimated_duration | estimated_days |
|--------------------|----------------|
| 0.5 weeks          | 3              |
| 1 week             | 5              |
| 1.5 weeks          | 8              |
| 2 weeks            | 10             |
| 2.5 weeks          | 13             |
| 3 weeks            | 15             |
| 3.5 weeks          | 18             |
| 4 weeks            | 20             |
| N weeks            | N × 5 (rounded up to nearest whole day) |

For durations expressed in days already (e.g., `5 days`), use the number as-is.

### Step 4: Update milestones.yaml

Add `estimated_days` to every milestone entry in `milestones.yaml`. Do not modify any other fields.

Example — before:
```yaml
- id: m0
  name: Foundation & Project Setup
  estimated_duration: 1 week
```

After:
```yaml
- id: m0
  name: Foundation & Project Setup
  estimated_duration: 1 week
  estimated_days: 5
```

### Step 5: Determine Project Size

Calculate `total_development_days` by summing `estimated_days` across all milestones.

**Large project** if either condition is true:
- `total_development_days > 30`
- Number of milestones > 5

Large projects receive two rounds of QA feedback by default, but this is **overridden by the user-provided `qa_rounds` value** from Step 2. `is_large_project` is still recorded in the summary for informational purposes.

### Step 6: Build the Development Timeline

Starting at Day 0, assign a `completion_day` to each milestone in dependency order. Each milestone's `start_day` is the `completion_day` of its last dependency (or 0 if no dependencies). Its `completion_day` is `start_day + estimated_days`.

For sequential milestone chains (each depends on the previous), completion days are simply cumulative:

```
m0: completion_day = 0 + estimated_days(m0)
m1: completion_day = completion_day(m0) + estimated_days(m1)
m2: completion_day = completion_day(m1) + estimated_days(m2)
...
```

For parallel milestones (same dependency), they share the same `start_day` but their `completion_day` is calculated independently.

`last_milestone_day` = the highest `completion_day` among all milestones.

### Step 7: Append Post-Development Timeline

Add delivery phase items starting from `last_milestone_day`. Each item has a `start_day` (day the work begins) and `completion_day` (day the work is done). Items with `estimated_days: 0` complete on the same day they start.

Use `qa_rounds` and `qa_days_per_round` from Step 2 to drive the QA section. The PR/merge/deployment phases before QA are fixed regardless of project size.

#### Fixed Pre-QA Phases (all projects)

| id                   | name                            | estimated_days | notes                              |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| post-pr-creation     | PR Creation                     | 0              | Opened on last milestone day       |
| post-pr-review       | PR Review                       | 2              |                                    |
| post-review-feedback | Review Feedback Implementation  | 2              |                                    |
| post-merge           | Merge                           | 0              | Same day as feedback impl          |
| post-deployment      | Deployment                      | 1              |                                    |

#### QA Phases (repeated for each round 1..qa_rounds)

For each round R from 1 to `qa_rounds`, generate the following phases using `qa_days_per_round` as the QA Deadline duration. Use round-specific ids (e.g. `post-qa-r1-deadline`, `post-qa-r2-deadline`). When `qa_rounds == 1`, ids may omit the round suffix (e.g. `post-qa-deadline`).

| id pattern                     | name pattern                            | estimated_days                        | notes                                            |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| post-qa-rR-deadline            | QA Deadline (Round R)                   | `qa_days_per_round`                   | Time allotted for QA team testing                |
| post-qa-rR-feedback-impl       | QA Feedback Implementation (Round R)   | 3 if (R == 1 and qa_rounds > 1) else 2 |                                                  |
| post-qa-rR-pr                  | QA PR (Round R)                         | 0                                     |                                                  |
| post-qa-rR-feedback            | QA Feedback (Round R)                   | 2 if (R == 1 and qa_rounds > 1) else 1 |                                                  |
| post-qa-rR-merge               | QA Merge (Round R)                      | 0                                     |                                                  |

#### Fixed Post-QA Phase (all projects)

| id            | name    | estimated_days |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| post-signoff  | Signoff | 1              |

### Step 8: Build Workback Schedule

Map every timeline item (milestones + delivery phases) to a real calendar date by working **backwards** from `production_deploy_date`.

**Anchor point:** `production_deploy_date` = the real date for `completion_day` of `post-signoff` (the final day of the timeline, `total_delivery_days`).

**Business day arithmetic:** When counting backwards, skip Saturdays and Sundays. One business day back from a Monday is the previous Friday.

**For each timeline item:**
- `completion_date` = `production_deploy_date` minus (`total_delivery_days` − `item.completion_day`) business days
- `start_date` = `production_deploy_date` minus (`total_delivery_days` − `item.start_day`) business days

**`project_start_date`** = `production_deploy_date` minus `total_delivery_days` business days (Day 0).

Include all items from `timeline` in the same order. Also append a final entry for `production-deploy` with `date: production_deploy_date`.

### Step 9: Generate timeline.yaml

Write `timeline.yaml` in the same directory as `milestones.yaml`.

## Output Format

The `estimated_days` field is added to each milestone entry. All other content is preserved exactly.
