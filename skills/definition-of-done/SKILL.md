name: definition-of-done
description: Generates per-milestone acceptance criteria from milestones.yaml and business-requirements.yaml. For each milestone, produces functional acceptance criteria, non-functional gates, testing requirements, documentation requirements, and an exit checklist. Outputs definition-of-done.yaml so teams know exactly when a milestone is complete.

# Definition of Done

Generates explicit, verifiable acceptance criteria for every milestone in `milestones.yaml`. Bridges the gap between "the plan says we're building X" and "we know for certain that X is done." Each milestone gets criteria derived directly from the requirements — not generic checklists.

## Prerequisites

- `{base_directory}/implementation/milestones.yaml` (output from `/implementation-planner`, with `estimated_days` added by `/delivery-timeline`)
- `{base_directory}/requirements/business-requirements.yaml` (output from `/business-requirements-interview`)
- Optional: `{base_directory}/requirements/technical-requirements.yaml` for NFR-derived gates

## Usage

```
/definition-of-done [base-directory]
```

If no directory is provided, auto-detect by looking for `implementation/milestones.yaml` in the current directory.

If not found, prompt the user: "Where are your planning artifacts located?"

Wait for the user to provide a path before proceeding. Store as `base_directory`.

## Process

### Step 1: Determine Base Directory and Load Artifacts

If no directory parameter was provided, check if `implementation/milestones.yaml` exists in the current directory.

- If found, use current directory as `base_directory`
- If not found, prompt: "Where are your planning artifacts located?" and wait for user response

Once `base_directory` is determined:

Read `{base_directory}/implementation/milestones.yaml` and extract each milestone's `id`, `name`, `description`, and any `deliverables` or `tasks` references.

Read `{base_directory}/requirements/business-requirements.yaml` and map each functional requirement to the milestone(s) most likely to deliver it. Use the milestone name and description to make this determination — do not guess at task-level details.

If `{base_directory}/requirements/technical-requirements.yaml` exists, read it to extract non-functional requirements (performance targets, security requirements, test coverage thresholds).

### Step 2: Derive Acceptance Criteria per Milestone

For each milestone, generate criteria in five categories:

**1. Functional Criteria**
Specific, observable behaviors that must be true when the milestone is done. Derive these from the business requirements mapped to this milestone. Each criterion must be:
- Verifiable without ambiguity ("users can log in with email and password" ✓ vs "login works" ✗)
- Tied to a requirement ID where possible
- Written as "Given/When/Then" or declarative present tense

**2. Non-Functional Criteria**
Performance, security, reliability, or accessibility requirements that apply to this milestone's output. Pull from `technical-requirements.yaml` NFRs if present. Only include NFRs that are *testable at this milestone's scope* — do not apply system-wide SLAs to early foundational milestones.

**3. Testing Requirements**
What test coverage must exist before this milestone is considered done:
- Unit test coverage for new modules/functions introduced
- Integration tests for any new service boundaries crossed
- E2E scenarios for any user-facing flows delivered
- Regression: confirm no existing tests are broken

**4. Documentation Requirements**
What documentation artifacts are expected from this milestone:
- Inline code comments for complex logic
- API documentation for any new endpoints
- README updates if setup/usage changes
- Architecture diagram updates if structure changes

**5. Exit Checklist**
A short, concrete checklist used at code review / milestone sign-off. This is the quick reference — summarize the above into yes/no checks.

### Step 3: Identify Cross-Milestone Gates

If any requirement spans multiple milestones (e.g., "end-to-end encryption" requires work in m1, m3, and m5), note it as a cross-milestone gate: the full requirement is only verifiable at the *last* milestone that contributes to it. Add a `cross_milestone_note` to each intermediate milestone.

### Step 4: Generate definition-of-done.yaml

Write `{base_directory}/delivery/definition-of-done.yaml`.

Create directory if it doesn't exist:
```bash
mkdir -p {base_directory}/delivery
```

### Step 5: Gap Analysis

Report inline after generating the file:

```
## Definition of Done Gap Analysis

**Project:** [name]
**Milestones with DoD:** [n]/[n]
**Functional Requirements Mapped:** [n]/[n]

**Criteria Quality:**
[✓ / ✗] All functional criteria are verifiable (no vague language)
[✓ / ✗] NFR criteria tied to specific thresholds (not just "must be fast")
[✓ / ✗] Every milestone has at least one testing requirement
[✓ / ✗] Cross-milestone requirements identified

**Unmapped Requirements:** [none / list requirements not tied to any milestone]

**Recommendations:** [none / list]
```
